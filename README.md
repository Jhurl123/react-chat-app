## Technologies

### React

React allowed for easy state management across an app with a surprising amount of moving parts. The React Context API is used to manage the global state of the project, to keep the functionality as close to native React as possible.

### Socket.io

Chat-app leverages socket.io to allow for real-time communication in the same way that a messenger app would

### Express

The backend of the application is written using the Node framework Express.js. Express.js was used to speed up development, and to use an architecture more familiar than Node's event driven architecture
